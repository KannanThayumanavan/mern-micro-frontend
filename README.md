# mern-micro-frontend
#### Mangahigh Tech Assignment Micro Frontend Full stack app, build with

  MERN stack (MongoDB Express React Node) - https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack
  
  Webpack Module Federation Micro-Frontend - https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/

## Installation
  ### server - to start Express NodeJS server and connect with mongoDB
     
     cd server
     
     npm install
     
     npm install -g nodemon

 ## Questions from assignment
  ### How you approached the project
  
   Read the document 
   
   Decided to go with the micro-frontend architectural approach
   
   Bootstrap(styles only) for responsive design
   
   Separated the features into independent modules, one to implement micro-frontend and another to improve the developer experience
   
   Must be unit tested

  ### What aspects of your solution youâ€™re most happy with
  
   MERN and Webpack Federation
    
  ### What you would do differently or improve on, given more time
  
   i18n Support
    
   Error boundary, SSR, CSS modules
    
   Jest browser snapshot testing
    
   Webpack independent test build based unit testing - https://scriptedalchemy.medium.com/module-federation-how-do-we-create-unit-tests-for-it-bd0d73c999bc
    
   eslint with full config (only syntax check included now)
    
   Encryption and decryption of data (stored in MongoDB)
    
  ### Roughly how long spent in total
  
   6 - 8 hours, that also includes a bit of learning, machine setup
